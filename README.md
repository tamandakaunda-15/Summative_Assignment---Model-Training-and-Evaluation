# Predicting Student Dropout in Malawi Using Machine Learning Classification Models

## Problem Statement

Despite education being a fundamental right, Malawi faces a severe learning crisis with significant dropout rates and poor learning outcomes. Only  58.5% of children complete the first four years of primary education(UNICEF), and just 19% of children aged 7 to 14 have foundational reading skills, while 13% have numeracy skills(Malawi Human Capital Index 2020).  Girls are mostly affected, with more girls dropping out than boys across all educational levels (UNESCO Institute of Statistics, 2016). This project develops machine learning models to predict student dropout risk, to enable targeted action points that reduce the risks of further dropouts.

## Dataset and Context

This project analyzes student data incorporating multi-dimensional factors critical to Malawi's educational landscape:
- **Demographics**: Age, gender, location, marital status
- **Socioeconomic factors**: Family income, parental education, poverty indicators
- **Social factors**: Early marriage risk, teenage pregnancy, community support
- **Academic factors**: Historical performance, attendance records
- **Infrastructure**: School accessibility, distance from home

### Original Analysis and Critical Insights

#### **Why L2 Regularization + Dropout Achieved Best Performance**

The **Adam+L2+Dropout** model achieved the highest F1-score (0.6667) due to a synergistic combination of optimization techniques

1. **L2 Regularization Impact**: L2 penalty (weight decay instead of zero reduction) prevented the model from overfitting to training data by reducing the weight magnitudes. This was particularly effective because our dataset has 33 features which has the potential for a multicollinearity between the social and academic factors.

2. **Dropout Complementarity**: The 0.3 dropout rate provided a different regularization mechanism by randomly reducing some neurons to zero during the training process.  This forced the network to learn varied combinations that don't depend on   the neural network.

3. **Adam Optimizer Stability**: Adam's adaptive learning rates handled the sparse gradients effectively, especially important given our mixed categorical/numerical features and class imbalance (more non-dropouts than dropouts).

#### **Optimizer-Specific Performance Analysis**

**RMSprop + L1 Performance (F1: 0.6512)**:
- Feature selection was performed by L1 which took most weights to zero.
- This was crucial for interpretability but it somehow reduced the capacity of the model.
- RMSprop's momentum helped navigate the non-smooth L1 penalty landscape
- **Critical Insight**:L1 indicated that family support and the study time were the most predictive features.

**SGD + L1_L2 Underperformance (F1: 0.6135)**:
- SGD required careful learning rate tuning (0.01) but still struggled with convergence
- Combined L1_L2 regularization created competing objectives that SGD couldn't balance effectively
- High dropout (0.4) compounded the training difficulty
- **Key Learning**: Complex regularization combinations require more sophisticated optimizers

#### **Traditional ML vs Neural Networks**

**Random Forest Tied Performance (F1: 0.6667)**:
- Achieved identical F1-score to best neural network
- **Advantage**: No hyperparameter sensitivity, natural feature importance ranking
- **Limitation**: Cannot capture complex non-linear feature interactions like neural networks
- **Practical Insight**: For this dataset size and complexity, ensemble methods are equally effective

**SVM Moderate Performance (F1: 0.6154)**:
- RBF kernel captured non-linear relationships but required extensive scaling
- **Critical Finding**: Performance highly sensitive to C parameter - wrong choice led to underfitting
- **Lesson**: SVMs require more careful preprocessing and validation than tree-based methods

#### **Error Analysis Deep Dive**

**Precision vs Recall Trade-off**:
- All models achieved higher precision (0.65-0.75) than recall (0.53-0.60)
- **Interpretation**: Models are conservative - when they predict dropout, they're usually correct
- **Business Impact**: Low false positive rate means intervention resources aren't wasted
- **Concern**: Missing 40% of actual dropouts could have serious consequences

**Class Imbalance Impact**:
- Dataset has ~80% non-dropout, 20% dropout students
- **Observation**: All models biased toward majority class
- **Solution Attempted**: Stratified sampling helped but didn't eliminate bias
- **Future Work**: Cost-sensitive learning or SMOTE could improve recall

#### **Optimization Technique Rankings by Impact**

1. **L2 Regularization**: +4.7% F1-score improvement over baseline
2. **Dropout (0.2-0.3)**: +3.2% F1-score improvement  
3. **Early Stopping**: +2.1% F1-score improvement
4. **Adam Optimizer**: +1.8% F1-score improvement over SGD
5. **L1 Regularization**: +1.5% F1-score improvement

#### **Practical Deployment Recommendations**

**Best Model Choice**: Adam+L2+Dropout neural network
- **Reasoning**: Highest F1-score with good generalization
- **Deployment**: Real-time prediction capability with 0.86 AUC-ROC
- **Monitoring**: Track precision/recall balance in production

**Alternative**: Random Forest for interpretability
- **Use Case**: When stakeholders need feature importance explanations
- **Advantage**: No neural network "black box" concerns
- **Trade-off**: Identical performance but better explainability

### Conclusions and Future Work
